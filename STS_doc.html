		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
		Sports Tournament Scheduling (STS) is a product of a project undertaken by 2 students (Davin and Yik Jiun) for their NUS module CS1010R - Javascript, under the guidance of Dr. Martin Henz.<br />
		As part of their project, they are to make use of a constraint library built by Srikumar (insert link to fd.js/references below) to create a simple to use, yet powerful <b>dense single round robin tournament scheduler</b>.<br />
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>Short definition of "Dense Single Round Robin"</i>
		<ul>Dense
			<li>Assume no breaks/rest in between rounds</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>Single Round Robin
			<li>Every team must play against every other team by the end of the tournament</li>
			<li>Each team can only play against one other team at any given round</li>
			<li>Each venue can only take 2 teams or 0 teams (i.e. unused)</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

				<p>
				As we can see, to complete a single round robin tournament with 4 teams, we need 3 rounds.<br />
				Let's focus on the first row (Team 1).<br /><br />
				As we can see:<br />
				In Round 1, Team 1 plays Team 2 at Venue 2.<br />
				In Round 2, Team 1 plays Team 3 at Venue 2.<br />
				In Round 3, Team 1 plays Team 4 at Venue 2.<br /><br />
				The other rows are to be interpreted in similar fashion.

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
		<p>
		<b>Q: How do I reset the scheduler?</b><br />
		Just press F5 or refresh your browser ;)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Q: Can I export the solution table?</b><br />
		Yes! Just select it with your mouse and copy-paste it!
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Q: What if I am holding the tournament at only 1 location with 3 courts?</b><br />
		Think of the "Venues" as "Courts" and name them as "Court 1", "Court 2" and "Court 3". Everything will work out :)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Q: What if I want breaks in between matches?</b><br />
		The "Rounds" are just to indicate the time frames for the matches. You can always hold them on separate days etc.
