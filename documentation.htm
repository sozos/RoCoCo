						Round-robin with Courts and Constraints (RoCoCo) is a product of a project undertaken by 2 students (Davin and Yik Jiun) for their NUS module CS1010R - Javascript, under the guidance of Dr. Martin Henz.<br />
						As part of their project, they are to make use of a constraint library built by Srikumar (insert link to fd.js/references below) to create a simple to use, yet powerful <i>dense single round robin tournament scheduler</i>.<br />

						A quick search online for "Sports Tournament Scheduling" gives us a top search result <a href="http://www.teamopolis.com/tools/round-robin-generator.aspx">Free Round Robin Tournament Generator Tool</a>. As you can see, the user interface is rather clunky and not intuitive.<br />
						Using Javascript and the fd.js library, we have created a quick, interactive and intuitively simple sports tournament scheduler. We also allow the user to define further constraints.
					</td>
					<td>
						<i>Dense</i><br />
						The schedule is organized in rounds, where in each round a team plays at most once.<br />
						"Dense" then means that the number of rounds is minimal.<br />
						For an even number of teams N, the number of rounds will be N-1, which means that each team plays exactly once in each round.<br />
						For an odd number of teams N, the number of rounds will be N; each team had one round in which it does not play.
						</p>
						<p>
						<i>Single Round Robin</i><br />
						Every team must play against every other team exactly once by the end of the tournament.
						</p>
						<p>
						<i>Venues</i><br />
						In each round, each venue can only host 2 teams or no teams (i.e. unused).

						As we can see, to complete a single round robin tournament with 4 teams, we need 3 rounds.<br />
						Let's focus on the first row (Team 1).<br /><br />
						As we can see:<br />
						In Round 1, Team 1 plays Team 2 at Venue 2.<br />
						In Round 2, Team 1 plays Team 3 at Venue 2.<br />
						In Round 3, Team 1 plays Team 4 at Venue 2.<br /><br />
						The other rows are to be interpreted in similar fashion.

					Just press F5 or refresh your browser ;)

					Yes! Just select it with your mouse and copy-paste it!
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>Q: What if I am holding the tournament at only 1 location with 3 courts?</b><br />
					Think of the "Venues" as "Courts" and name them as "Court 1", "Court 2" and "Court 3". Everything will work out :)
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>Q: What if I want breaks in between matches?</b><br />
					The "Rounds" are just to indicate the time frames for the matches. You can always hold them on separate days etc.
